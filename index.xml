      <description>Micro Project #1. Please read my Hello World post to find out more about this blog. This fortnight I&amp;rsquo;m working with Ansible to automate blog hosting along with server management.
This blog post is a hands down tutorial on provisioning a server by hosting a blog using Git and nginx with Ansible.
 Ansible is a configuration management system. Ansible by default uses the SSH protocol to manage machines.</description>

      <description>This is my new blog theshapguy.com. Also, my new year&amp;rsquo;s resolution.
Firstly, a bit of background, I have been learning to program for two years and done nothing much with it. Meaning, I have had no productivity with programming - ABSOLUTE ZERO! Every time I start a project, I manage to somehow stuff it inside my archive folder. And this year is going to change.
I will be creating a mini project every two week, and in a like manner, a bigger project every month this year.</description>
